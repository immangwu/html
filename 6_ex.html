    <h1>What is a Website?</h1>
    <p> A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified
      by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org,
      google.com, and amazon.com.</p>
    <h2> Websites</h2>
    <p>All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.
      There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network,
      such as a company's internal website for its employees.</p>
    <h3>Uses </h3>
    <p>Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education,
      commerce, entertainment, or social networking. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site,
      which often starts with a home page.</p>
    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
      The app used on these devices is called a web browser.</p>
